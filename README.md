# Tulia Protocol

## Overview
Tulia is a revolutionary peer-to-peer lending platform that offers users unparalleled control over their financial activities. Our platform allows users to create and manage their own lending pools, earning staking rewards while awaiting borrowers. This experimental protocol is designed to provide individual control and flexibility, but it is still in the testing phase.

## Important Notice
**Do not use this protocol in production.** Tulia is currently experimental and not ready for production use. There are likely to be significant errors and the platform requires extensive testing and debugging.

## Testnet Information
Tulia is currently being tested on multiple testnets:
- Binance Smart Chain (BSC) Testnet
- Base Sepolia
- Ethereum Holesky

The testnet phase is crucial for identifying and resolving issues. We encourage users to participate in the testnet to help us improve the protocol.
